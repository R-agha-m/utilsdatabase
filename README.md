# DATABASE UTILITIES PACKAGE
This is not a coherent software. I gathered and developed database related codes that I use them in my many projects. 
Thereby, I gathered them here for coherence across all my projects.

---

- **connection_string.py**: create the connection string to connect to the database
- **crud**: a package to implement create, read, update and delete actions on objects in database
- **exceptions.py**: basic exceptions for this package
- **logo.py**: the logo of this package
- **stg.py**: settings of this package
